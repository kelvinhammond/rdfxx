This project aims to wrap librdf, the Redland libraries, in C++.

It provides librdfxx for access to RDF data stores;
and rdf2dot for creating the input to the GraphViz dot program for displaying RDF.

WARNING
This is prototype quality code. You should not install it into /usr etc
until the final version of SASSY is released.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need the development versions of libxml2, and librdf
(the latter should include librasqal and libraptor).

You will also need to build and install the SASSY CFI project.
(The librdfxx does not need this, but the test program and rdf2dot do.)


Set an environment variable called SASSY to the directory to install into.
$ cd ~/sassy
$ export SASSY=$(pwd)

You may need to rebuild CFI to install into this directory.

Build Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unpack the tar file.
cd into sassy-rdfxx.0.0

Create a build directory and configure the software for your environment:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure --prefix=$SASSY

Build and test:
$ make
$ make check

Install into $SASSY
$ make install
